      <p>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or Global Goals are a collection 
        of 17 interlinked global goals designed to be a "blueprint to achieve a better
         and more sustainable future for all". The SDGs were set up in 2015 by the 
         United Nations General Assembly and is intended to be achieved by 2030. 
         They are included in a UN-GA Resolution called the 2030 Agenda. The SDGs were 
         developed in the Post-2015 Development Agenda 
         as the future global development framework to succeed the Millennium Development 
         Goals which were ended in 2015. </p>

        <p> This site has been created to explain easily the fifth SDG to everyone.
            On the left side of the page is always displayed a series of buttons wich allows to move yourself trough the entire site.
            Their use is very intuitive as they all have the topic of the related page written on top of them.
            <p></p>
            The colors have been choosen in relation to the Goal 5 main color: red. 
            The buttons colour is blue wich commonly is considered the opposite of red, 
            the contrast between the two colours allows to feel a difference between the pages sections.

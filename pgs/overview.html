        <p> Sustainable Development Goal 5 concerns gender equality 
            and is fifth of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals established 
            by United Nations in 2015. The 17 SDGs recognize that action in 
            one area will affect outcomes in others, and that development 
            must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability. 
            A system thinking approach is the base for global sustainability.</p>
